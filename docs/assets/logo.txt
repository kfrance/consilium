# Consilium Logo Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the project logo. 

In a real implementation, this would be replaced with an actual logo image file (PNG, SVG, etc.).

For the Consilium project, consider creating a logo that represents the concept of a "council" of AI agents working together, perhaps with elements suggesting productivity, intelligence, and organization.
