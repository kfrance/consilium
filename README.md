# Consilium

![Consilium Logo](docs/assets/logo.png)

Consilium (Latin for "council") is a multi-agent AI system designed to help you achieve goals, plan your time, store notes, and track tasks. Think of it as having your own council of AI assistants, each specialized in different aspects of personal productivity and knowledge management.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Planning** - Set and manage goals across different time horizons, from 5-year plans to daily tasks
- **Smart Note Taking** - Capture and organize thoughts with AI-enhanced organization
- **Task Management** - Collect and organize todos from multiple sources
- **Document Intelligence** - Ask questions about your documents and notes using RAG technology
- **Multi-Agent System** - Access specialized AI agents for different needs
- **Multi-Provider Support** - Use LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and more
- **Offline First** - Work with or without an internet connection
- **External Integrations** - Connect with ClickUp, email, calendar, and more

## Vision

Consilium aims to be more than just another productivity tool. By combining the power of modern AI with a thoughtfully designed user experience, we're creating a system that adapts to your workflow rather than forcing you to adapt to it.

Our core principles:

1. **AI as a Council, Not a Commander** - Multiple specialized agents working together to assist you
2. **Your Data, Your Control** - Privacy-first approach with local-first storage when possible
3. **Seamless Integration** - Connect with the tools you already use
4. **Adaptive Intelligence** - Learn from your patterns to provide better assistance over time
5. **Human-Centered Design** - Technology that adapts to humans, not the other way around
